This module helps avoiding basic typos when filling a civicrm powered form that contains an email field.

For instance if I'm trying to make a donation with the email john.doe@gmail.cm, it will suggest "Did you mean john.doe@gmail.com". 
If I then clicks on the (correct) suggested email, it automatically updates the email field.

It is a thin wrapper around the mailcheck plugin https://github.com/Kicksend/mailcheck
By using a few simple but effective rules, it claims to decrease the number of invalid emails by 50%
